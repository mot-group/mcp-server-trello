# Trello MCP Server Skill

Use this skill when an agent needs to inspect or manage Trello boards through
the MCP server. The install script builds the server from this repository's
root source (the single source of truth) and installs it locally on first use.

## Activation

Before using Trello tools, verify that the local server has been installed.

1. Check for a built server at:
   `{XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/mcp-server-trello-skill/server/build/index.js`
2. If it is missing, run:
   `bash {skill-root}/scripts/install.sh`
3. Confirm the MCP client has `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN` configured.
   Optional values are `TRELLO_BOARD_ID`, `TRELLO_WORKSPACE_ID`,
   `TRELLO_BLOCKED_WORKSPACES`, `TRELLO_BLOCKED_BOARDS`,
   `https_proxy`, and `HTTPS_PROXY`. Access is open by default; the blocklist
   variables deny specific IDs. The legacy `TRELLO_ALLOWED_*` variables are no
   longer supported and fail fast at startup.

The install script builds from the repository root source when Bun is available.
If Bun is not available (or the skill directory is used standalone, outside the
repository), it falls back to the published package install path and creates a
local wrapper at the same `build/index.js` check path.

## Reading Order

Load only the reference needed for the current Trello task.

- Start with `references/trello-mcp/README.md` for routing.
- Use `references/trello-mcp/configuration.md` for authentication, install, and
  client setup.
- Use `references/trello-mcp/api.md` when you need tool names and parameters.
- Use `references/trello-mcp/patterns.md` for common board, card, checklist,
  and attachment workflows.
- Use `references/trello-mcp/gotchas.md` for date formats, IDs, rate limits,
  and recovery steps.

## Tool Routing

Choose tools by workflow, not by guessing IDs.

- Board discovery: `list_boards`, `set_active_board`,
  `get_active_board_info`, `list_workspaces`, `set_active_workspace`,
  `list_boards_in_workspace`.
- Lists and cards: `get_lists`, `get_cards_by_list_id`, `get_card`,
  `add_card_to_list`, `update_card_details`, `move_card`, `archive_card`,
  `copy_card`, `add_cards_to_list`, `get_my_cards`, `get_card_history`.
- Checklists: `create_checklist`, `get_checklist_items`,
  `add_checklist_item`, `find_checklist_items_by_description`,
  `get_acceptance_criteria`, `get_checklist_by_name`,
  `update_checklist_item`, `delete_checklist_item`, `copy_checklist`.
- Comments: `add_comment`, `update_comment`, `delete_comment`,
  `get_card_comments`.
- Attachments: `attach_image_to_card`, `attach_file_to_card`,
  `attach_image_data_to_card`, `download_attachment`.
- Labels and members: `get_board_labels`, `create_label`, `update_label`,
  `delete_label`, `get_board_members`, `assign_member_to_card`,
  `remove_member_from_card`.
- Health: `get_health`, `get_health_detailed`, `get_health_metadata`,
  `get_health_performance`, `perform_system_repair`.

## Agent Rules

- Always discover the board, list, card, checklist, label, or member ID through
  tools before writing changes.
- Prefer `set_active_board` after board discovery when several operations target
  the same board.
- Use start dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Use due dates as full ISO 8601 timestamps.
- Treat Trello API writes as external side effects. Confirm destructive actions
  such as archive, delete, or repair unless the user already authorized them.
- Respect Trello rate limits: 300 requests per 10 seconds per API key and 100
  requests per 10 seconds per token. The server queues requests, but agents
  should still batch discovery and avoid polling loops.
